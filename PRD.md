Data Models
Core Data Entities

User: Profile, friends, preferences
Restaurant: Name, location, cuisine type
MenuItem: Name, price, category, ingredients
Analysis: Margin calculation, value rating
Poll: Question, options, votes, participants
Message: Content, sender, timestamp

API Integrations Needed

 Restaurant identification service (Google Places, Yelp)
 Ingredient pricing data (custom API or scraping)
 Push notification service
 Analytics platform
 Crash reporting service

Security Considerations

 Implement proper user authentication
 Secure API communications (HTTPS only)
 Protect user privacy in data collection
 Implement proper data encryption
 Add rate limiting for API calls
 Secure storage of sensitive data

App Store Preparation

 Create app icons (all required sizes)
 Prepare screenshots for App Store
 Write app description and keywords
 Set up App Store Connect
 Configure TestFlight for beta testing
 Prepare privacy policy and terms of service

Success Metrics to Track

 User retention rates

Notes

Start with MVP focusing on photo capture and basic analysis
Prioritize camera performance and reliability
Consider using TestFlight extensively for user feedback
Plan for iterative improvements based on user behavior
Keep data collection transparent and valuable for users
